# AttriSync (WIP_)
AttriSync, a simple feature for web developers, allows you to dynamically link and synchronize content across multiple elements on your web pages. No more manual updating of repeated content. With AttriSync, you change it once, and it reflects everywhere - instantly.

## Feature Highlights:

- Synchronized Text: Duplicate written content across your site without having to manually update each instance. Update your text in one place, and AttriSync will propagate the changes wherever needed.

- Image Duplication: With AttriSync, you can seamlessly update images site-wide from a single source. Make your changes once and watch them reflect in real-time across all linked instances.

- Link Management: AttriSync simplifies link management like never before. Update a link's destination at the main source and it updates everywhere else.

## Use Cases:

- Blog Management: Keep your blog headings, content, and call-to-actions consistent across your website. Changes made to the main instance will reflect across all linked instances.

- Site-Wide Announcements: Need to propagate the same announcement or message across multiple web pages? AttriSync ensures that your message stays consistent and updated in real-time.

## Documentation coming soon
